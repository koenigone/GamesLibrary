<h1>Games Library | React Projectj</h1>

A mini React application that allows users to discover games by genre.
It offers the ability to filter games by genres and platforms, making it easy to find titles that match specific preferences.
The application retrieves real-time game data from the RAWG.io API
and presents it using Chakra UI for attractive styling, a clean layout, and a fully responsive design.
